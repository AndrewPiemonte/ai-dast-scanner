# SPIDER_MAX_DURATION – Controlled Web Crawling in OWASP ZAP

# 📌 Disclaimer  

This document is not authored by an official security expert or OWASP ZAP developer. It is compiled from publicly available resources and general best practices.  

While intended to provide guidance on OWASP ZAP features, **all configurations should be reviewed by a qualified security professional before deployment.** Users should test and validate implementations to ensure they meet specific security requirements.  

For official documentation and best practices, visit [OWASP ZAP’s official site](https://www.zaproxy.org/).  

## What It Is  
`SPIDER_MAX_DURATION` sets the **maximum time (in minutes)** that the OWASP ZAP spider will run to discover URLs on a website. This prevents infinite crawling and optimizes performance.  

---

## **Default Behavior (No Time Limit)**
- By default, **ZAP’s spider runs indefinitely**, crawling all discovered links until it has exhausted the site structure.
- This is useful when performing **deep security assessments** but may introduce unnecessary delays in automated testing or cause resource-intensive scans.

### ✅ **Benefits of the Default (Unlimited Time)**
| **Benefit** | **Why It Matters** |
|------------|--------------------|
| 🔍 **Comprehensive Crawling** | Ensures **all** pages, including hidden or deeply nested ones, are found. |
| 🛠️ **Better Coverage for Manual Testing** | Helps security researchers manually analyze **large** attack surfaces. |
| 🔄 **Ideal for One-Time Full Scans** | Useful for **thorough security audits**, where time isn't a constraint. |

### ⚠️ **Risks of the Default (Unlimited Time)**
| **Risk** | **Potential Issues** |
|------------|--------------------|
| ❗ **Very Long Scans** | Large sites may take **hours or even days** to fully spider. |
| ❗ **High Resource Usage** | Can overload **CPU, memory, and network bandwidth**. |
| ❗ **Website Blocking** | Some sites detect long-running crawlers and **block or throttle** them. |
| ❗ **Unpredictable CI/CD Performance** | Automated security scans may **slow down builds** or cause failures. |
| ❗ **Unnecessary Traffic** | Generates excessive requests, which could **disrupt real users** or **trigger DDoS protections**. |

## **Why Set a Time Limit?**
Setting a time limit prevents **unnecessary crawling delays** and makes scans **more efficient**.

### ✅ **Benefits of Setting a Time Limit**
| **Benefit** | **Why It Matters** |
|------------|--------------------|
| 🚀 **Faster Scans** | Prevents excessive crawling and speeds up security testing. |
| 🔄 **CI/CD Integration** | Ensures scans complete within a predictable time in automation pipelines. |
| 🛑 **Avoids Getting Blocked** | Reduces the risk of IP bans or rate limits from the target website. |
| 🏗️ **Optimizes Resources** | Saves CPU, memory, and bandwidth, especially in cloud environments. |
| 🎯 **Improves Test Focus** | Helps prioritize high-risk areas rather than crawling every single link. |

## **Recommended Time Limits for Different Scenarios**  

| **Use Case**        | **Recommended Value** |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Small site (< 50 pages)  | **5 minutes**  |
| Medium site (100-500 pages)  | **10-15 minutes**  |
| Large site (500+ pages)  | **30-60 minutes**  |
| CI/CD pipelines (fast automation)  | **5 minutes**  |
| Sites with rate limits / bot detection  | **2-5 minutes**  |

## **How to Set the Spider Time Limit**
### **YAML Configuration**
```yaml
SPIDER_MAX_DURATION: 10  # Limits the spidering process to 10 minutes
