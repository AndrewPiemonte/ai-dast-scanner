# ALPHA_RULES – Experimental Security Checks in OWASP ZAP  

## What It Is  
The **Alpha Rules** in OWASP ZAP are **experimental security tests** that have not yet been fully validated for accuracy and performance. They are in development and may detect **new vulnerabilities** but can also introduce **false positives** or performance issues.  

## **Default Behavior (Alpha Rules Disabled)**
- By default, **Alpha scan rules are NOT enabled** in ZAP.
- These rules **may contain false positives** or **be unstable**, so they are not included in standard scans.

## **Benefits and Risks of Using Alpha Rules**
### ✅ **Benefits of Alpha Rules**
| **Benefit** | **Why It Matters** |
|------------|--------------------|
| 🔎 **Detects New Vulnerabilities** | Includes security tests that may not be in the stable release. |
| 🏗️ **Early Access to New Checks** | Useful for security researchers testing cutting-edge vulnerabilities. |
| 🚀 **Expands Scan Coverage** | Covers additional attack vectors that stable rules may not include. |

### ⚠️ **Risks of Alpha Rules**
| **Risk** | **Potential Issues** |
|------------|--------------------|
| ❗ **False Positives** | Some Alpha rules may incorrectly flag pages as vulnerabilities. |
| ❗ **Performance Impact** | May slow down scans due to unoptimized rules. |
| ❗ **Unstable Behavior** | Some rules may be incomplete or produce inconsistent results. |

## **When to Use Alpha Rules?**
| **Use Case** | **Recommended?** |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Standard website security scans** | ❌ **No**, stable rules are sufficient. |
| **Advanced penetration testing** | ✅ **Yes**, Alpha rules help find new vulnerabilities. |
| **Security research & bug bounty** | ✅ **Yes**, early access to experimental checks. |
| **CI/CD pipelines for automated testing** | ❌ **No**, false positives may break automated workflows. |

## **How to Enable Alpha Rules**
### ✅ **Command-Line (ZAP CLI)**
```yaml
alpha: true  # Enables AJAX-based crawling
