This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) frontend of our platform and the Amplify backend (under ./amplify). To successfully run this application (even on local host) please follow the [deployment instructions](/README.md#deployment-guide). If for some reason you want to run this platform on local host, you should first download the [amplify_outputs.json](https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/reference/amplify_outputs/) of the Amplify application (into this directory), you can find it under "deployment backend resources" of your latest deployment. Then run the following commands in your terminal: 

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
